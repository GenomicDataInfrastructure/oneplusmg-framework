### [Use case demonstrator package](https://zenodo.org/records/11635576)

This deliverable focuses on creating a use case demonstrator package, which includes an initial set of data collections tailored for specific use case scenarios within the European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI). Given the current lack of real data in the GDI nodes, efforts were concentrated on gathering synthetic and other available real data that closely align with intended use cases to facilitate comprehensive testing of the GDI infrastructure.


### [Report to identify the initial set of relevant data for use cases](https://zenodo.org/records/10887528)

Establishing minimal datasets and standards within GDI facilitates seamless data exchange, driving innovation in healthcare and improving patient outcomes. Deliverable 7.4 encapsulates the collaborative efforts of GDI, 1+MG, and B1MG initiatives towards establishing minimal datasets and standards for genomic data exchange and integration. Efforts focused on leveraging prior work from 1+MG and B1MG initiatives to define minimal datasets for GDI use cases, particularly in Cancer, Infectious Diseases and the Genome of Europe. Collaborative refinement processes ensured comprehensive standards adherence.

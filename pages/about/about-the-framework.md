The [1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes) aims to enable secure access to genomics and the corresponding clinical data across Europe for better research, personalised healthcare and health policy making. Since the Digital Day 2018, 25 EU countries plus the United Kingdom and Norway signed the Member States’ Declaration ‘Towards access to at least 1 million sequenced genomes in the EU by 2022. This plan consists of stepping up efforts towards creating a European data infrastructure for genomic data and implementing common national rules enabling federated data access. The initiative forms part of the EU’s agenda for the Digital Transformation
of Health and Care and is aligned with the goals of the European Health Data Space (EHDS). The updated [1+MG Roadmap](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/99974), published in Q3, 2023, sets out the priorities for the period 2023-2027.

The [Genomic Data Infrastructure](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/) (GDI) project (2022-26), is enabling access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data across Europe. It is deploying a federated, sustainable and secure infrastructure to access the data, based on the guidelines and recommendations in the 1+MG Framework. GDI builds on the outputs of the B1MG, B1MGplus and the Genome of Europe projects to realise the ambition of the 1+Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative.

The [Genome of Europe](https://genomeofeurope.eu/) (GoE) project (2024-28) is building a collective reference genome cohort of European citizens, selected to mirror the genetic composition of the European population. This will generate a solid basis for the development of personalised medicine and health approaches in Europe.

The [Beyond 1 Million Genomes](https://b1mg-project.eu/) (B1MG) project (2020-2023), provided coordination and support to the 1+ Million Genomes Initiative (1+MG). Working closely with stakeholders, it defined the legal, organisational and technical requirements for cross-border access to genomics and personalised medicine data, and translated these into practical technical specifications and implementation guidelines. 

The [Beyond 1 Million Genomes plus](https://b1mgplus.onemilliongenomes.eu/) (B1MGplus) project (2025-28), a follow-up to the B1MG project, is facilitating the adoption of shared standards and best practices, encouraging stakeholder engagement and ensuring alignment with the objectives of the European Health Data Space. The project is providing support to help countries move from pilot phase to operational services that are embedded in national healthcare and research systems.


## Framework contents and EC projects

The 1+MG Framework is meant to provide a user friendly interface to navigate the guidelines and recommendations provided by the 1+MG Working Groups and the project supporting the initiative across the different phases of its implementation: currently the European GDI project.

It contains the set of agreed outputs and guidance on:

* [**Legal, ethics and governance**](/governance-elsi) \
Governance documentation including consent models, privacy safeguards and legal frameworks
* [**Technical infrastructure**](/technical-infrastructure) \
Information on the standards, APIs and reference implementations to build a 1+MG Node
* [**Data and metadata**](/data-metadata) \
Resources on data models, minimal metadata, quality and inclusion standards
* [**Healthcare integration and sustainability**](/genomics-into-healthcare) \
Guidance for preparing health systems to adopt genomics, including a maturity model and long-term sustainability planning 
* [**Use cases**](/usecases) \
The use cases and analysis driving the development of the 1+MG infrastructure

<!-- B1MG defined the initial architecture, shared interfaces, and possible virtualisation platforms required to achieve technical interoperability. In addition, the proposed infrastructure must support semantic interoperability, so a variety of international standards were proposed to support this. The below EOSC Interoperability Layers (adapted from Nictiz NL) have been considered throughout the development in the 1+MG resources to enable broad European interoperability of the infrastructure.

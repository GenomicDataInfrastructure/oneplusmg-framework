title: National implementation
description: Introduction to national implementation
---

The National Implementations section of the 1+MG Framework is designed to be a place for the 1+MG National Mirror Groups to share their solutions, personalised resources, and national technical implementations to the pan-European guidance given through the Initiative.  This should both help 1+MG countries display their accomplishments in the area of genomic data sharing to support research and precision medicine as well as act as a resource for other countries to find solutions to the national challenges that they face.

Below, the resources can be found both by catagory and by country:

## Implementations by Category

* ### Training materials
* ### <a href="{{'/technical-implementation' | relative_url}}">Technical implementations</a>
* ### ELSI documents
* ### Sequencing Guidelines
* ### Sustainability Plans
* ### National Genomic Plans

<br />
## Implementations by Country

To contribute your country’s Genomic Data Infrastructure’s solutions, please email [framework@elixir-europe.org](mailto:framework@elixir-europe.org) and include your country, a permanent, sharable link to your resource and the category or categories under which it fits.  If you are not the National Mirror Group lead for your country, please make sure you copy them into the email for approval.

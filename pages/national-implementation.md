description: National implementation through the 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs)
---
The 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs) are the key instrument for implementing the 1+MG EU-level guidelines and recommendations presented in this framework across EU countries according to their national reality (learn more about NMGs <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5018535">here<a>). 

The National Implementations section of the 1+MG Framework is designed to be a place for the NMGs to share their progress, personalised resources and national technical implementations of the different aspects of the 1+MG Framework. This should help 1+MG NMGs to: 
1) Onboard national players that could contribute data, provide services or request access to data
2) Act as a resource for other countries to find exemplary solutions to their national challenges, sharing knowledge

## National Mirror Groups

### [Guiding Principles and Best Practices](https://zenodo.org/records/10058201)

The NMGs Contact points will play a key role in supporting national players and interacting with other NMGs to build capacity across 1+MG countries. Prototypical questions they could need to answer could be for national players: How can I engage with the initiative? How can I find data available? What do I need to share my data? How can I run my pipeline? How do I connect with my institute? For NMGs: How are you organised? How can I get access to your service implementation? Note that a helpdesk will be delivered as part of GDI to support NMGs contact points among other users and stakeholders.

### Description of National Mirror Groups status and recommendations

This deliverable presents the results of the first activities of National Mirror Group (NMG) support of the GDI project. The activities are classified as follows:1) Analysis of the NMG status in collaboration with ELIXIR and 2) Fostering participation and capacity-building actions. 

## National implementations

The 1+MG Initiative and related projects provide technical and ELSI guidelines which can be adapted to local needs while maintaining harmonisation. Below are examples of how various countries have made these guidelines work within national contexts, found by both category and country:

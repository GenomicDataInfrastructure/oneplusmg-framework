description: National implementation through the 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs)
---

The 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs) are the key instrument for implementing the 1+MG EU level guidelines and recommendations presented in this framework across EU countries according to their national reality (learn more about NMGs <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5018535">here<a>) <b>. 
The National Implementations section of the 1+MG Framework is designed to be a place for the NMGs to share their progress, personalised resources, and national technical implementations of the different aspects of the 1+MG Framework.  This should both help 1+MG NMGs to onboard national players that could contribute data, provide services or request access to data, as well as act as a resource for other countries to find exemplary solutions to the national challenges that they face, sharing knowledge and building capacity.
The NMGs Contact points will play a key role in supporting national players as well as interacting with other NMGs to build capacity across 1+MG countries. Prototypical questions they could need to answer could be for national players:
How can I engage with the initiative? How can I find data available? What do I need to share my data? How can I run my pipeline? How do I connect my institute? for NMGs: How are you organised? How can I get access to your service implementation?

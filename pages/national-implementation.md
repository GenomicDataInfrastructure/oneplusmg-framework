title: National implementation.
description: National implementation through the 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs)
---

The 1+MG National Mirror Groups (NMGs) are the key instrument for implementing the 1+MG EU level guidelines and recommendations presented in this framework across EU countries according to their national reality (learn more about NMGs <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/5018535">here<a>). 

The National Implementations section of the 1+MG Framework is designed to be a place for the NMGs to share their progress, personalised resources, and national technical implementations of the different aspects of the 1+MG Framework.  This should both help 1+MG NMGs to: 1) onboard national players that could contribute data, provide services or request access to data. 2) act as a resource for other countries to find exemplary solutions to their national challenges, sharing knowledge.

The NMGs Contact points will play a key role in supporting national players and interacting with other NMGs to build capacity across 1+MG countries. Prototypical questions they could need to answer could be for national players: How can I engage with the initiative? How can I find data available? What do I need to share my data? How can I run my pipeline? How do I connect with my institute? For NMGs: How are you organised? How can I get access to your service implementation? Note that a helpdesk will be delivered as part of GDI to support NMGs contact points among other users and stakeholders.
